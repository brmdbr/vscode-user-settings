# vscode-user-settings
Some personal user settings from my Visual Studio Code environment to share with different machines.


 ## Settings file locations ##
By default VS Code shows the Settings editor, but you can still edit the underlying settings.json file by using the Open Settings (JSON) command or by changing your default settings editor with the workbench.settings.editor setting.



Depending on your platform, the user settings file is located here:


Windows %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json

macOS $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json

Linux $HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json
